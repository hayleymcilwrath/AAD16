Design Journal for introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
------

In week 1 of Ixd we got a brief introduction of the course and course contents. They told us what they expected off us and what we would been doing the rest of the week. We then got told to download a programme named 'Atom'. Tim then took us through briefly the programme and gave us some tips on atom. For example if you hit *view* and then *Toggle Soft Wrap* it converts all the writing to the one side allowing you to view all your writing. Makes life easier! another tip that has helped me is *Shift-Control-M* which allows you to view your final piece of work. 

As our first project Paul gave us a text file which we then had to render what we seen in markdown. This is my final piece as of below:
