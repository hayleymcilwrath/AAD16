Design Journal for introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
------

In week 1 of Ixd we got a brief introduction of the course and course contents. They told us what they expected off us and what we would been doing the rest of the week. We then got told to download a programme named 'Atom'. Tim then took us through briefly the programme and gave us some tips on atom. For example if you hit *view* and then *Toggle Soft Wrap* it converts all the writing to the one side allowing you to view all your writing. Makes life easier! another tip that has helped me is *Shift-Control-M* which allows you to view your final piece of work.

As our first project Paul gave us a text file which we then had to render what we seen in markdown. This is my final piece as of below:



Ireland's rugged coast yields
=================
Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
-----------------
###by Robert Sténuit

A WILD NORTH WIND lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

  >“In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called *Port na Spaniagh*, ‘the port of the Spaniards’.”

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:**

* A ornamental winged salamander
* Gilded brass dolphin
* Lapis lazuli cameos
* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats

**The Author**: Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in **“The Deepest Days”**, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

I achieved this by adding headlines, paragraphs, list items and block quotes. Although I could not make this a perfect match as this will come later using CSS.

We then started of team work exercises and this consisted of the class being put into teams of 4 and brainstorming ideas of space onto a mind map. This helped with making friends and getting to know my class mates. Once we had made several mind maps they were used to create an idea on an app or website relating to space, as Chris loved space!

Our group created an app which was educational to kids but also a game which was a rocket were you had to shoot space related objects flying at it. A finger tap on the object destroyed it. We made the target audience 7-15 as we knew the app was more for the younger generation.

**29.09.2014 Friday lecture**
-------------------------

At fridays lecture we got told a brief overview of what we will be learning over the 12 weeks and also what Paul is looking from us as an individual.

We started by Paul telling us the importance to know the past before we can learn the future as he said " The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated". we looked at people such as Dieter Rams who was born in Germany in 1932 and created the for the Braun Radio. The next designer was Jonathan Ive who was influenced by Rams to invent the first IMac and IPod.

Another designer who stood out was Russell Mills as I liked his design 9 inch nails. As I love the texture in his art work and how when you look closely you can see the point, line and plane in his pieces:

I love how I can now look at a peice of art and I can see point, plane and lines and I can examine it in so much more depth and I love how I have learnt to see it in this way. It excites me!






I also learned that Jonathan Ive was an English designer that created the first apple laptop and he would not of created this if he was not influenced by Dieter Rams. Understanding the history helps with future design and can help with creating the next huge big thing.

We then looked a guy called  Guillermo del Toro who is an example as he used past artists to produce the horrifying monsters in **Pacific Rim** He's now producing FX Networks such as vampire themed TV movie The Strain and prepping Jessica Chastain's 2014 horror movie Crimson Peak. This just goes to show what you can do with history knowledge.

My favourite peice from Guillermo del Toro even though its just his quick sketch/journal book:

Week 2
------

This week consisted of making a hello world page with Tim who kindly created the page and we then as individuals had to add our own content and short bio about ourselves. I enjoyed doing this as it gave me a feel of my own personal profile being out there for the world to see. This was my final creation below:

![screen shot 2014-10-17 at 12 17 24](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4677973/4cc1175a-55ef-11e4-9d07-6583cf399c0d.png)

To achieve my hello world page I had to do some research on different designers to build up my knowledge on the way they presented themselves on the internet as I wanted to look professional but also let my personality shine through.

The first designer I found was Jessica Hitche
![screen](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4888402/9394fb1a-638c-11e4-881c-cb60090865d9.png)

I liked Jessica's style of her writing and how she came across professional yet I wanted to read on through her bio because it was humours and caught my attention.

For more of the style of my hello world page I found a designer called Adham Dannaway. I liked the style of his text as its short and sweet yet to the point but it still looks good:
![great-author-bios](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4889084/dd8a5d5e-6392-11e4-9cba-f9628b2ee8b0.jpg)

This influenced my bio layout as I liked the way he had his text positioned.
​Overall I feel these two designers influenced me and helped me develop my overall page. As i feel I come across professional, yet it lets my personality shine through.








Cave Paintings
--------------

##Prehistoric Grafitti##

Today we learned about cave paintings and early man graffiti which I found really interesting as I have always enjoyed looking at prehistoric drawings and he design of the cave paintings (always have loved learning about the past). These were thousands of years old and held a lot of expression through man in those days. Famous cave paintings and  Ancient rock art made with images of human hand stencils and depictions of wild animals can be found in the cave Cantabria as its very well known for its Cave paintings of various animals of the time such as bison, horses, goats, deer, cattle, hands and other paintings.

Roof of the Cave of Altamira and other famous cave paintings:

I love the way the paintings are so natural and just used by mans hand onto a natural rock. i also love modern day graffiti as cave paintings has had an impact on todays art and loads of artist have found inspiration in this:

Banksy:
--------
![images](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4746531/c38575fc-5a4a-11e4-919b-361c950bbed0.jpg)

Banksy, a street artist who unlike many other famous artists, Bansky has tried to keep his identity under wraps for years. Yet, with such a controversial reputation, it’s no wonder that keeping his identity a mystery has proven to be a challenge. He has featured his work around the world, raising eyebrows whilst gaining world-wide recognition and hundreds of thousands of followers. his work consists of political themes, satirically critiquing war, capitalism, hypocrisy and greed. This type of work tends to get a lot of attention!

Golden Ratio
------------

 >“Without mathematics there is no art,”  said Luca Pacioli, a contemporary of Da Vinci.

The golden ration is abundant in nature and is used by many artists as inspiration comes from nature, art and music ect.

But by the mid 15th Century that was about to dramatically change and the days of the Illuminated Scripts were numbered




Week 3
------
Guttenburg and Beyond
--------------------

This week we covered the pioneers of type design, looked into the brief history and looked at some examples of type design. We also covered The invention of the printing press and the impact it had. We also looked at how the printing press had shaped the design of type.

Scriptorium which is monks writing the inslur script 600-850AD
The inslur script was a medieval script system originally used in Ireland which spread, by way of Anglo-Saxon England, to continental Europe under the influence of Irish Christianity.

![bookofdurrowbeginmarkgospel](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4983732/447c3c00-691d-11e4-93aa-721272b1fee5.jpg)

Works written in Insular scripts commonly use large initial letters surrounded by red ink dots and usually every paragraph will start with a large letter:

![script _chad-gospels](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4983832/4ab4ac82-691e-11e4-8ab3-0ed213fd4686.jpg)




Blackletter
============

Blackletter, also known as Gothic script, is basiclly bold block writing. It continued to be used for the German language until the 20th century. This is now known as Gothic Script.

![620px-calligraphy malmesbury bible arp](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4983998/a9819436-691f-11e4-8e8d-85b557c348ab.jpg)


Blackletter is sometimes called Old English, but it is not to be confused with the Old English language, popular now for writing titles and even tattoo artists would use this. Blackletter developed from Carolingian as an increasingly literate 12th-century Europe

Type is the clothing for words
===============================

>**Note to self** : Need to be careful on what type writing you choose as every font you use gives off an impression!

We then looked at how logos for branding use type and what impression. As they use primary colours and they give off the impression of plain boring logo's and fonts.


![300px-burger_king_logo svg](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4984344/f0e42642-6922-11e4-8e8c-22335db2f327.png)

![mcdonalds_logo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4984345/f243a7f6-6922-11e4-9db0-13b725861806.png)

![kfc-sogood-vector-logo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4984347/f3fda196-6922-11e4-98a0-e964c069702d.png)



They give the impression of poor food as dear restaurants have more of a detailed logo and have fancier text and colour. They put more effort into these as they need to give off more of a impression towards their image.

**Group presentation research:**
------------------------------

This week as part of our overal mark we had to make a group presentation, and our group  on The Pioneers of Digital Design.

My two designers was *John Whitney* and *Zuzana Licko*

***Slide 1***

-John Whitney was born in 1917 and died in 1995  which weirdly was my birth year.
-He is known as one of the true pioneers of computer generated art.

-He taught the first computer graphics class at UCLA in 1972

-He had a lot of knowledge on Computer Graphics

-he developed animation techniques which he made into commercials for the t.v which was amazing at this point in time.

-he founded Motion Graphics company which he used a mechanical analogue computer of his own invention to create motion picture and television.

-He continued on to write the amazing book called
Digital Harmony
some of his inspiring work is on the next slide

My research Websites were:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Whitney_(animator)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbV7loKp69s
http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.5/2.5pages/2.5moritzwhitney.html

***Slide 2***

-he created a computerized instrument on which he composed a visual and musical output in real time which you can see ^^

-this was created as he operated one of the first computer-graphics engines.

My main research for this slide was the book Digital Harmoney which give me background knowledge on his work and how he created his work.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Harmony-Complementarity-Music-Visual/dp/007070015X

***Slide 3-***
was just another photo of his work

***Slide 4-***

-Suzana Licko is a type face designer.
 born in 1961

-She started a design company Em -i- gre Graphics in 1984 which became extremely well known world wide.

-She was greatly inspired by the new technical possibilities of the Macintosh computer.

-this caused her to produce her first typeface
on her next slide

***Slide 5-***

-Very first font she made
and ended up designing more than two dozen typeface families

-She created this typeface by sticking to the limitations,

-which didn't allow curv-a-ture.

[Basicly this slide consisted of describing her work and the way Zuzana did not use curvs in her as she used pixels on the macintosh]

***Slide 6-***

Another piece of work she created was taking fonts and creating patterns with them

This consisted of describing another peice of Zuzanas work as she would take a letter form and twist and rotate it which made really interesting patterns

I feel our overall presentation went well and although I was really nervous, I presented it with confidence. The thing I need to improve on is taking my time when reading things out and not rushing through it due to nerves.
