Design Journal for introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
------

In week 1 of Ixd we got a brief introduction of the course and course contents. They told us what they expected off us and what we would been doing the rest of the week. We then got told to download a programme named 'Atom'. Tim then took us through briefly the programme and gave us some tips on atom. For example if you hit *view* and then *Toggle Soft Wrap* it converts all the writing to the one side allowing you to view all your writing. Makes life easier! another tip that has helped me is *Shift-Control-M* which allows you to view your final piece of work. 

As our first project Paul gave us a text file which we then had to render what we seen in markdown. This is my final piece as of below:



Ireland's rugged coast yields
=================
Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
-----------------
###by Robert Sténuit

A WILD NORTH WIND lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

  >“In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called *Port na Spaniagh*, ‘the port of the Spaniards’.”

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf. 

**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:**

* A ornamental winged salamander
* Gilded brass dolphin
* Lapis lazuli cameos
* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats

**The Author**: Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in **“The Deepest Days”**, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

I achieved this by adding headlines, paragraphs, list items and block quotes. Although I could not make this a perfect match as this will come later using CSS.

We then started of team work exercises and this consisted of the class being put into teams of 4 and brainstorming ideas of space onto a mind map. This helped with making friends and getting to know my class mates. Once we had made several mind maps they were used to create an idea on an app or website relating to space, as Chris loved space!

Our group created an app which was educational to kids but also a game which was a rocket were you had to shoot space related objects flying at it. A finger tap on the object destroyed it. We made the target audience 7-15 as we knew the app was more for the younger generation. 

**29.09.2014 Friday lecture**
-------------------------

At fridays lecture we got told a brief overview of what we will be learning over the 12 weeks and also what Paul is looking from us as an individual. 

We started by Paul telling us the importance to know the past before we can learn the future as he said " The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated". we looked at people such as Dieter Rams who was born in Germany in 1932 and created the for the Braun Radio. The next designer was Jonathan Ive who was influenced by Rams to invent the first IMac and IPod.

Another designer who stood out was Russell Mills as I liked his design 9 inch nails. As I love the texture in his art work and how when you look closely you can see the point, line and plane in his pieces:

I love how I can now look at a peice of art and I can see point, plane and lines and I can examine it in so much more depth and I love how I have learnt to see it in this way. It excites me!






I also learned that Jonathan Ive was an English designer that created the first apple laptop and he would not of created this if he was not influenced by Dieter Rams. Understanding the history helps with future design and can help with creating the next huge big thing.

We then looked a guy called  Guillermo del Toro who is an example as he used past artists to produce the horrifying monsters in **Pacific Rim** He's now producing FX Networks such as vampire themed TV movie The Strain and prepping Jessica Chastain's 2014 horror movie Crimson Peak. This just goes to show what you can do with history knowledge. 

My favourite peice from Guillermo del Toro even though its just his quick sketch/journal book:

Week 2
------

This week consisted of making a hello world page with Tim who kindly created the page and we then as individuals had to add our own content and short bio about ourselves. I enjoyed doing this as it gave me a feel of my own personal profile being out there for the world to see. This was my final creation below:

Cave Paintings
--------------

##Prehistoric Grafitti##

Today we learned about cave paintings and early man graffiti which I found really interesting as I have always enjoyed looking at prehistoric drawings and he design of the cave paintings (always have loved learning about the past). These were thousands of years old and held a lot of expression through man in those days. Famous cave paintings and  Ancient rock art made with images of human hand stencils and depictions of wild animals can be found in the cave Cantabria as its very well known for its Cave paintings of various animals of the time such as bison, horses, goats, deer, cattle, hands and other paintings.

Roof of the Cave of Altamira and other famous cave paintings:

I love the way the paintings are so natural and just used by mans hand onto a natural rock. i also love modern day graffiti as cave paintings has had an impact on todays art and loads of artist have found inspiration in this:

Banksy:
![banksy_october_41 copy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8985471/4746425/5fca4188-5a49-11e4-86fc-02a807a51f7a.jpg)

Banksy, a street artist whose identity remains unknown is very well known for his striking images, often combined with slogans. His work often engages political themes, satirically critiquing war, capitalism, hypocrisy and greed. This type of work tends to get a lot of attention!
